RUNNING THE WEB SERVER
============================================================
Extract "testing.tgz" and use it as your webserver root
directory. Run your webserver using the following command

./web_server_http <port> <path_to_testing>/testing <num_dispatch> <num_worker> <num_prefetch> <queue_len> <mode> <cache_entries>

For example, to run the web server at port 9000, with root directory "/home/student/joe/testing" with 100 dispatch, worker and prefetch threads,
queue length 100, in CRF mode and 100 cache_entries run the following command

./web_server_http 9000 /home/student/joe/testing 100 100 100 100 1 100


Open another terminal and issue the following command,

wget -i <path-to-urls>/urls -O results 

In our case we should run
wget -i /home/student/joe/testing/urls -O myres

The above command will ask wget to fetch all the URLs listed
on the file named "urls" that you downloaded from the assignment page.

Once wget is finished, compare your webserver log file with our log file
name "webserver_log" that you can download from the assignment page.
