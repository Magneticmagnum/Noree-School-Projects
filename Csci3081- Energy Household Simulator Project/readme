About
-----

This is our submission for Phase 3 of the class project. It is a simple energy
simulator that manages a number of Models over a series of ticks, our time unit
that is equivalent to that of a real life minute. With each tick, we examine
each model's current power consumption and total energy use, recording the
values in a number of logs for each item.

As the simulation continues, various Models will interact with one another,
keep track of their various states, and return these values to the main
program.

In this latest version, we have implemented the option to create script files
for both the person class and Scheduler class in order to customize the
simulation to our liking with out changing the code.



Build Instructions
------------------

This program can be build using the various 'make' commands listed below.

make -  Builds the Simulator executable file, runs the unit tests and coverage,
        and creates the documentation

make simulator -  Builds the Simulator executable file only

make run_tests - Runs the unit tests only

make test_coverage - Builds and runs the test coverage only

make doc - Creates the documentation using Doxygen in a folder labeled 'html'

make clean - Deletes any and all files created by the Makefile



Execution Instructions
----------------------

In order to run the actual simulation process, you first must make sure you 
have either made all or made the Simulator using the above make commands. 
Making the Simulator creates an executable file in your directory called 
'Simulator'.

Once everything is created and confirmed, make sure you are in your top-level
directory and then type:

./simulator (-d <run length>) <model-spec> <person-spec1> ... <person-specn>

<model-spec>  There should be the filename of a model-spec file that lies
              in the same directory as the executable.

<person-spec> There can be multiple person spec files listed after the model
              spec files. List one for every person created in the model-spec
              file.

<run length>  The run-length, if listed with tag -d will run the simulation
              for the given integer amount of ticks. Otherwise, it will run
              a default amount of time.


NOTE: The locations of the person-spec files cannot have spaces (" ") within
      the path.
      


Examples
--------
How to Run Examples

After the project has been made using the make command (see above) you can now
run various examples.

To run the Phase2 example from the main folder, enter into the terminal on
a single line:

./simulator [-d numberOfDays] doc/Phase2-Sample/phase2_model_list
    doc/Phase2-Sample/phase2_script

To run the multi-person example from the main folder, enter into the terminal:

./simulator [-d numberOfDays] doc/Multi-Person-Sample/multi-person-models
    doc/Multi-Person-Sample/homer-script doc/Multi-Person-Sample/marge-script



Creating Specification and Script Files
---------------------------------------

For detailed information on creating specification and script files, please
generate the documentation (make docs) and consult the Person Class page and
other model pages for creating the person script file and model spec files
respectively.
