We had four sessions in which we met as a group to work on the project, but we were never able to meet all at once due to schedule conflicts. Though these meetings were very helpful and productive, it often meant other members were stuck trying to catch up on and individual basis. The project itself was not particularly difficult, but learning subversion was a little difficult at first. Once we got the hang of it though, we found the ability to easily update files and work on an individual basis incredibly useful. In the future, we will probably make more extensive use of its features as finding times to work together proved more difficult than expected.
